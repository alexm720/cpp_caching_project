//! Xetdataâ€™s high performance cache is a core piece of our tech stack. Caches show up everywhere
//! there is a need for low latency and the cost of remote calls is significant.
//!
//! For this programming challenge you will build a cache which will enable a charting UX to be
//! built on top of the OpenWeatherMap temperature API.
//!
//! In terms of user stories,
//! 1. As a user, I can initialize an OpenWeatherCache with a latitude and a longitude representing
//!    a geographic location.
//! 2. As a user, I can access the forecasted temperature of my chosen geographic location for a
//!    time range and time granularity with an initialized OpenWeatherCache. The granularity of the
//!    returned temperature data varies as the time range increases in the following manner: (a)
//!    When the time range is less than 2 hours, return the data at a minute's granularity (b) When
//!    the time range is less than a day, return the data at five minute granularity
//!    (c) Return the data with an hour granularity
//!
//!    You are allowed to implement this solution in any system language of your choice. Candidates
//!    have chosen C++, C#, Java, Golang, and Rust.
//!
//!    You will spend face-to-face with your interviewer to make sure that all your questions are
//!    answered. Once you start on the challenge, you will have access to a slack channel in case
//!    you would like to clarify any confusion.
//!
//!    This challenge is typically finished in around 3-4 hours.
//!    What we are looking for in your submitted artifacts
//!      - Implement the functionality. With Rust, you should be able to run
//!      `cargo run -- -d 2days vancouver` and `cargo test`. Choose similar tooling for your chosen
//!      language.
//!      - Documentation explaining your choices: programming language, caching technology,
//!      parallelism and async options, testing approach, etc.
