# Useful cpp packages for this assignment
Given that CPP does not have a universally adopted package manager
(unlike npm, pip, gem, crates, etc.), the following is the set of useful
installs
1. https://github.com/Kronuz/cpp-btree for BtreeMap
2. https://github.com/nlohmann/json for json parsing
3. https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp for making REST client
   (based on libcurl)
4. https://github.com/banditcpp/bandit.git for writing modern unit tests
5. <Algorithms>, <chrono>, <map> dependencies
